# Lindsay Kriz CSPB 3112 Semester Project

## 12/14/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>This past week I worked on finalizing my 'Junior Developer Help Guide'. I still need to format the Git and Jira sections and post it to Medium.com, but otherwise I like it. I'm going to continue adding to it as I encounter obstacles in my day job.</li>
 <li>N/A</li>
 <li>I was limited by time and health over the past few weeks. I'm pregnant (on purpose :) ) and it's been making me very sick the past few weeks. I've essentially had to mega prioritize what I use my 'good' hours on, but I'm still happy with what I've accomplished this semester. </li>
 <li>Although my project may not be very 'complicated', I have benefitted from spending time learning more about the foundational skills we have to use as new developers. My coworkers and manager also really like my Guide. I definitely plan on continuously adding to it and posting it to Medium.com in hopes that other new developers will find it helpful.</li>
</ol>

## 12/07/2023 Project Update
<ol>
  <li>This past week I finished the remaining LinkedIn Learning courses and added more notes to my 'How To Guide'. I've renamed the 'How To Guide' to 'Junior Developer Help Guide'. </li>
 <li>This week I plan on finalizing my 'Junior Developer Help Guide' and if I have extra time I'll complete another LinkedIn Learning course that could add more good details to my guide. Once my guide is finished, I'm first going to look into posting it on Medium.com. If I complete that, then I'll post it on LinkedIn and on the CUPBCS slack channel. </li>
 <li>I don't have anything that should impeded my progress over the next week. I'll be pushing to finish everything on time. </li>
 <li>I'm excited to finish this project and post it to Medium.com. I'm hoping the article will be a great add to my resume.</li>
</ol>

## 11/16/2023 Project Update
<ol>
  <li>This past week I didn't make much progress because I was traveling for work the entire week. I'm a bit behind in my schedule right now, but I have a significant amount of time available over the next week to dedicate to this project. I did submit what I have thus far of my 'How To Guide' to one of my coworkers to review this week while I was traveling. I should received edits back from him at the end of this week. </li>
 <li>This week I plan on finishing what's remaining of my LinkedIn Learning courses. I then plan on finishing the draft of my 'How To Guide'. One of my coworkers is already reviewing the 'How To Guide', but I plan on sending it to a few others for their review next week. After I apply their edits, I should be close to finalizing the 'How To Guide'.</li>
 <li>I don't have any work or personal events that should impede my progress over the next week. </li>
 <li>I am very much looking forward to Thanksgiving week as a chance to mentally relax a bit and catch up on this project :)</li>
</ol>


## 11/10/2023 Project Update
<ol>
  <li>This past week I didn't make a lot of progress because I was out of town on vacation in a remote location and I had a data science test this week that I had to study for. I did make a few edits to my 'How To Guide' during the week when things came up at work that I thought would be useful to add. </li>
 <li>This week and next week (since the week after is Thanksgiving, I need to spend time finishing the LinkedIn Learning courses on my weekly plan. I also want to aim to finish the draft of my 'How To Guide' by the end of Thanksgiving week. That will give me time to let a few of my coworkers review it before it's due. </li>
 <li>I have to travel for work all of next week and be in all day meetings. This could impede my progress, but I plan to work on my 'How To Guide' while on the flights. </li>
 <li>I still feel behind right now, but I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving break as a chance to catch up and finish my 'How To Guide'. </li>
</ol>

## 11/01/2023 Project Update
<ol>
  <li>This past week I worked on completing the two LinkedIn Learning courses "Learning Jira (Cloud Edition)" and "Planning and Releasing Software with Jira". Those courses are pretty dense and I had to stop and take notes frequently. It made the relatively short courses more time consuming. </li>
 <li>This week, I need to spend substantial time adding notes to my 'How To Guide' from the Jira courses I completed. I took a lot of notes and I expect that it will take me a few hours to add those notes to the 'How To Guide' and work on the formatting. The formatting is a bit unorganized right now.</li>
 <li>I'm about to leave for vacation, but I don't think that will impede my progress since I plan on working on my 'How To Guide' while driving (I won't be driving, of course).</li>
 <li>I do feel a bit behind right now since the Jira courses took so long to digest. I'm glad we have a break coming up in a few weeks, it will give me multiple uninterrupted days to catch up on anything I feel behind on.</li>
</ol>

## Mid-Semester Project Update
I'm feeling good about my progress on my project thus far. The 'How To Guide' has really started to take shape and I'm excited to see where it ends up. I'm staying on track with my weekly plan which makes me think I'll accomplish all of my original goals for the project. However, I'm hoping I don't have too many more weeks like this one where I add more to the project plan. That could potentially derail my progress.
Initally I thought that completing rudimentary courses in LinkedIn Learning wouldn't yield a 'hard enough' project, but I'm actually really thankful for the foundation the courses are giving me. So many pieces of information are assumed in the professional space and I'm happy that I've been given the time to concretely learn them. 

## 10/19/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>This past week I worked on completing the LinkedIn Learning course "Learning Jira (Cloud Edition)". Per my weekly schedule, I was supposed to complete the course "Using common Bitbucket features", but I realized that that isn't a full course, it's a snippet of the course "Planning and Releasing Software in Jira". I've worked in Jira for many years on the business side, but since I'm new to working in Jira on the developer side, I decided to start with the first Jira course in that instructor's series. </li>
 <li>This week, per the weekly schedule in my project proposal, I plan on adding a section to my 'How To Guide' on using Bitbucket and Jira. I also plan on completing the two Jira courses I discussed above. This is more than what is on my weekly schedule, but I think I can get it done.</li>
 <li>I don't have anything this upcoming week that should impede my progress.</li>
 <li>I'm glad I decided to do more Jira courses than originally planned. I know it's not always the best to deviate from the original plan, but I think doing the extra courses will create a much better end result in my 'How To Guide'.</li>
</ol>

## 10/12/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>This past week I completed the LinkedIn Learning course 'Programming Foundations: Version Control with Git’. I didn't have time to add more notes to my 'How To Guide'. I'll need to do that this upcoming week.</li>
 <li>This week, per the weekly schedule in my project proposal, I plan on completing the LinkedIn Learning course 'Using Common Bitbucket Features’. I'll add notes from this course and from the Programming Foundations course to my 'How To Guide'.</li>
 <li>I don't have anything this upcoming week that should impede my progress. I have a test in Data Science tomorrow, but after that I should have more available time again.</li>
 <li>I think I did as much as I could over the past week considering I had a test this week, too. I want to start focusing on the overall flow of my 'How To Guide' over the next week and pick a date to request my coworkers to review the 'How To Guide' as midterm review.</li>
</ol>

## 10/05/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>This past week I created the 'How To Guide' for my project, per the schedule outlined in my project proposal. I started the sections for 'Version Control' and 'Large Code Repositories' using information from the 'Git Essential Training' LinkedIn course and tips from my coworkers.</li>
 <li>This week, per the weekly schedule in my project proposal, I plan on completing the LinkedIn Learning course 'Programming Foundations: Version Control with Git’. I'll add notes from this course to my 'How To Guide'.</li>
 <li>The only thing that may impede my progress over the next week is that I have a test in my Data Science Algorithms course. However, I plan on doing the majority of the studying over the weekend.</li>
 <li>I noticed over the past week that I need to commit more frequent chunks of time to this progress during the week. The workload for the Data Science course is increasing, which means I need to schedule smaller, but more frequent, chunks of time to this project to keep myself on track. </li>
</ol>

## 09/28/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>This past week I completed the course 'Git Essential Training' in LinkedIn Learning, per the schedule outlined in my project proposal. I also had a few meetings at work that generated great notes on using Git in a professional setting.</li>
 <li>This week, per the weekly schedule in my project proposal, I'll create the ‘How To’ guide and add a section for version control & Git. I'll also include the notes from my meetings this past week</li>
 <li>I shouldn't have anything impeding my progress over the next week besides having the flu right now (thanks, work conference).</li>
 <li>One of the successful things I did last week was not being afraid to ask 'dumb' questions to my coworkers and managers about the use of version control in a professional setting. They liked being included in the discussion and shared many helpful tips and tricks. </li>
</ol>


## 09/21/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>This past week I worked further on my project proposal. I created a weekly schedule for the semester to keep me on track. I also did a lot of version control work at my job this week that will help my project and 'How To' guide.</li>
 <li>This week, per the weekly schedule in my project proposal, I'll complete the course 'Git Essential Training' in LinkedIn Learning.</li>
 <li>The only thing impeding my progress this week and next week is that I'm traveling for work both weeks. I plan on making progress on the weekly task even while traveling for work.</li>
 <li>One of the successful things I did last week was utilizing my project management experience to update my project proposal and create a weekly schedule. </li>
</ol>


## 09/14/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>Last week I worked through my Company's repo to get ideas for my project. During that review I realized that it would be more beneficial for me to do my project on things that can be difficult to grasp for all new developers - version control with git, utilizing and keeping many libraries (node modules and bower libraries) up to date and best practices for organizing and navigating large code repos. I began my more in depth research on node modules and bower libraries. I also drafted my project proposal.</li>
 <li>This week I plan on drafting the outline for my new developer 'How To' guide. I also plan on completing at least one hour of LinkedIn Learning and updating my GitHub page to make it look more professional.</li>
 <li>There isn't anything impeding my progress thus far.</li>
 <li>One of the successful things I did last week was thinking through my project while working on tasks during my daily job tasks. It helped me think about what type of project would actually be beneficial for me and others. </li>
</ol>


## Project Proposal - "Version Control, Libraries & Large Repos - Making the Jump from Academic to Professional Software Development"
<ul>
 <li>Vision statement: Starting a fulltime position as a software developer is an exciting time. Junior developers gain a wealth of knowledge throughout a Computer Science program, but there is a significant amount of topics that are not covered in school that are required of new developers. Some of the topics expected of new developers include version control, working with large-scale code repositories and third-party libraries. This project will expand my professional skills and knowledge by helping me learn and become more comfortable with large-scale code repositories (repos), version control and libraries. We work with many code repos in school, but the size and complexity are limited. The jump is quite large from an undergrad academic code repo to a professional code repo. This project will help be become more proficient in working with professional code repos and may provide as a guide for future software developers looking to move into a fulltime positions. </li>
 <li>Motivation: This project is important to me because I am currently struggling with navigating a large code repo and managing version control in my position as a Junior Software Developer. I'm hoping this project will help me feel more confident and add more value in my day to day work.</li>
 <li>Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project:
     <ul>
      <li>Complete 3-5 courses on LinkedIn Learning, including (but not limited to): Git Essential Training, Programming Foundations: Version Control with Git, Manage third-party packages with npm, Using common Bitbucket features, Docker vs. Kubernetes</li>
      <li>Compile a 'How To' guide for new software developers working with a professional code repo for the first time.</li>
      <li>Document project progress and the ‘How To’ guide on a GitHub page</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Risks to project completion:
     <ul>
      <li>Needing to learn a new technology (Docker)</li>
      <li>Time required to allow for asking questions to experienced developers</li>
      <li>Time constraints between working a full-time job, working a part-time job and completing two courses this semester</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li>The mitigation strategy for the items above is to put effort into scheduling the completion of milestones in the project with ample time built in to ask questions when I inevitably hit road blocks.</li>
 <li>
  The assessment for this project will follow the breakdown below:
   <ul>
      <li>Completion of at least 20 hours of LinkedIn Learning courses – 50%</li>
      <li>Completion of the 'How To' guide – 40%</li>
      <li>Posting the ‘How To’ guide to LinkedIn and the CUPBCS Slack channel – 10%</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Project Schedule</li>

</ul>


## 09/04/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>Last week I researched the type of project I want to complete this semester. I also reviewed the LinkedIn Learning course offerings and saved courses that I want to complete.</li>
 <li>This week I plan on beginning the 'straw man' plan for my project. I also want to start the repo for my project.</li>
 <li>There isn't anything impeding my progress thus far.</li>
 <li>One of the successful things I did last week was posting in Piazza about my project idea. I really liked the feedback I got and it gave me a good path forward for setting up my project.</li>
</ol>
