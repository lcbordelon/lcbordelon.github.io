# Lindsay Kriz CSPB 3112 Semester Project

## Project Proposal - "Version Control, Libraries & Large Repos - Making the Jump from Academic to Professional Software Development"
<ul>
 <li>Vision statement: This project will expand my professional skills and knowledge by helping me learn and become more comfortable with large scale code repositories (repos), version control and libraries. We work with many code repos in school, but the size and complexity are limited. The jump is quite large from an undergrad academic code repo to a professional code repo. This project will help be become more proficient in working with professional code repos and may provide as a guide for future software developers looking to move into a fulltime positions. </li>
 <li>This project is important to me because I am currently struggling with navigating a large code repo and managing version control in my position as a Junior Software Developer. I'm hoping this project will help me feel more confident and add more value in my day to day work.</li>
 <li>Specific and measurable goals (learning objectives) for the project:
     <ul>
      <li>Complete 3-5 courses on LinkedIn Learning, including (but not limited to): Git Essential Training, Programming Foundations: Version Control with Git, Manage third-party packages with npm, Using Using common Bitbucket features, Docker vs. Kubernetes</li>
      <li>Compile a 'How To' guide for new software developers working with a professional code repo for the first time.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Risks to project completion:
     <ul>
      <li>Needing to learn a new technology (Docker).</li>
      <li>Time required to allow for asking questions to experienced developers.</li>
     </ul>
 </li>
 <li>The mitigation strategy for the items above is to put effort into scheduling the completion of milestones in the project with ample time built in to ask questions when I inevitably hit road blocks.</li>
 <li>
  The assessment for this project will be 60% for completion of at least 20 hours of LinkedIn Learning courses and 40% for the completion of the 'How To' guide. Overall, this project will be complete once I have a 'How To' guide that I can use moving forward in my career. I also want to post the 'How To' guide on LinkedIn and the CUPBCS Slack channel for others to utilize.
 </li>
</ul>


## 09/04/2023 Project Update
<ol>
 <li>Last week I researched the type of project I want to complete this semester. I also reviewed the LinkedIn Learning course offerings and saved courses that I want to complete.</li>
 <li>This week I plan on beginning the 'straw man' plan for my project. I also want to start the repo for my project.</li>
 <li>There isn't anything impeding my progress thus far.</li>
 <li>One of the successful things I did last week was posting in Piazza about my project idea. I really liked the feedback I got and it gave me a good path forward for setting up my project.</li>
</ol>
